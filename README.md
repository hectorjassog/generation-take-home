Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is my solution to Generation's Take-Home Coding Challenge.

### Objective
The objective was to create a sample app that could fulfill the requirements for certain user stories.

### Dependencies
Instead of reinventing the wheel, I took advantage of libraries that were created by other people. I decided to focus more on the user experience, rather than on the technology itself.
* **google-maps-react**: A "declarative Google Map React component using React, lazy-loading dependencies, current-location finder and a test-driven approach by the Fullstack React team". I was used to load the map and to add ceratin functionality to it.
* **json-loader**: Module used to import json files.
* **enzyme and jest**: Testing libraries.
* **google maps API**: API used for displaying and working with the map.
